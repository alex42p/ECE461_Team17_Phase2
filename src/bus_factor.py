"""
DOCTYPE: Bus Factor metric for repository sustainability.
This module defines BusFactorMetric, which inspects the number of unique recent
committers (from metadata) and estimates the project's resilience to developer
loss. It normalizes the committer count into [0,1] by dividing by 10 and capping
at 1.0: a repo with â‰¥10 active committers scores 1.0, while 0 committers scores
0.0. The metric also includes details showing the raw count.
