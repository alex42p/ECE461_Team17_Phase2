"""
DOCTYPE: Bus Factor metric for repository sustainability.
This module defines BusFactorMetric, which inspects the number of unique recent
committers in the repository entity and estimates the project's resilience to
developer loss. It normalizes the committer count into [0,1] by dividing by 10
and capping at 1.0: a repo with â‰¥10 active committers scores 1.0, while 0
committers scores 0.0. The metric also includes details showing the raw count.
